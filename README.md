## Requirements
Make sure the following requirements are installed:

## Installation
**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and
remove things you donâ€™t want or you don't need. Use at your own risk!

Two things before proceeding:
  1. Before installing anything, you **must** install the `stow` package: check its [README](stow/README.md)!
  2. Before installing a package, remember to check `README` to get more information!

First of all, clone this repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yverek/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
```

Now, you can install every package you want using just [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow)
```bash
$ stow zsh
```
 
To remove dotfiles
```bash
$ stow -D zsh
```

## Updating
```bash
$ git pull origin master
```

## Thanks
